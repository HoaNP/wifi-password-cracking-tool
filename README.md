# wifi-password-cracking-tool

WPA, "WiFi Protected Access", is, as its name suggests, a mechanism for protecting access to WiFi networks intended to replace WEP which does not have a sufficient level of security (the "breaking" of the WEP protection can be achieved in a few minutes on a personal computer).

WPA-PSK which is the security method for wireless networks usesAES-CCMP. WPA-PSK is vulnerable to a dictionary attack. The goal of this project is to create a tool allowing the password used to protect a WiFinetwork protected by WPA-PSK to be found using a "brute force" method.

*This project is for educational purposes and cannot be used on a WiFi network for which you do not have prior authorization to access. The information that you will find automatically, on the network configuration, must remain confidential.*
